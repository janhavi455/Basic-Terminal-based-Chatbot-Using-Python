1. i didn't write suitable case handeling when the intent goes unknown, 
so for that i need to write a suitable response for unknown intent.
2. "for word in list_text:
if word in data["keywords"]" -> this was crashing because instead of first searching
in keywords and then comparing with the user_ip i was searching in user_ip and searching in
keywords.
FIX: first search in keywords and then compare with user_ip.
3. earlier in Intent dict for greeting key for keywords key the data was ["Hey","Hello"]
but as the text is getting in lowercase this was crashing the logic.
Fix: make all the words in keywords in lowercase because for preprocessing we are lowercasing 
the characters.
4. case handling for intent="unknown" is not compatible with logic because for responsefunct
the expected op is Intent[intent]["response"] but current version -> "unknown": "Chatbot didn't understand the text."
dont have any "response" value for intent="unknown"
FIX: the response value for intent="unknown" must be added.
RULE-> all intents must have the same schema.
5. redundancy issue -> in main funct the intent is classified and for respond funct too the intentis
calculated again twice.
FIX: pass the intent value to respond.
